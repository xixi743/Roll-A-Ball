# Roll-A-Ball
I followed Unity's Roll A Ball Tutorial to create this game. A good start! Hoping to add on more feature as I learn more about Unity.

Find the tutorial on Youtube:

Also find it on Unity's Learning Pages:

Overall, a great tutorial and it explains all the differnt ways you can complete the same task in Unity. It's very clear and the project itself is pretty simple, so great for a beginner (like myself). It took me 3 hours to complete - a night put to good use!
